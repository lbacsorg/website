                The ubiquitous nature of computing and the Internet has radically changed the manner in which information is managed, shared, and preserved. Issues of intellectual property (IP) protection, security, privacy rights, confidentiality, authorization, access control, authentication, integrity, non-repudiation, revocation, and recovery are at the heart of many important societal changes. </br></br>

                The Alliance’s program combines the teaching/learning of the above topics with the existing course material on the technology aspects of information processing, i.e., hardware, software, and the network. </br> </br>

                The program aims to develop technological, legal, and societal solutions for issues that arise out of computer applications and information processes in the new millennium. The training and education curricula will be made possible by a coalition of several academic units (K-12, community college and university), parents of K-12 students, teachers in these schools, government and industry organizations, and an advisory council consisting of industry, government, schools and university representatives.</br></br>

                This solution will work at all levels—high school, two-year college, bachelor’s programs, and graduate school – and further bring together the educational partners to align their respective programs. Students would graduate when they have stacked a sufficient number of credentials in specific pathways. The Program will align the CSULB and LBCC cybersecurity education efforts with those of K-12 to create a streamlined approach to cybersecurity education leading to different levels of specialization in strong employment sectors of the region. The structural goal the Program is to create pathways from K-12 through to college and university diplomas.

                    Cybersecurity is everyone’s responsibility. In recognition of that, the Long Beach Alliance in Cybersecurity is providing research, education, and outreach to help train a cyber-aware and cyber-alert workforce to effectively protect local and national cyber interests such as Long Beach Airport, the port of Long Beach in addition to various local industries. </br>

                    Building upon the nationally recognized Long Beach College Promise—a four-way partnership between California State University Long Beach, Long Beach City College, Long Beach Unified School District, and the City of Long Beach – the Alliance’s comprehensive curriculum will serve the needs of the region’s diverse employers and create a next-generation workforce.

                </p></br>
                <p><strong>The curriculum addresses topics such as:</strong></p>
